# Tree Database Schema

The database schema for representing the tree structure is based on a single table called `Tree`. The table contains the following columns:

- `node_id` (Primary Key): An integer value that serves as a unique identifier for each node in the tree.
- `name`: A text field that holds the name or label of each node.
- `parent_id` (Foreign Key): An integer value that references the `node_id` of the parent node for establishing the hierarchical relationship.

The database table follows a simple parent-child structure to create and manage the tree hierarchy.

### Table: `Tree`

| Field Name | Data Type    | Constraints                 |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| node_id    | INT          | Primary Key, Auto-Increment |
| name       | VARCHAR(255) | Not Null                    |
| parent_id  | INT          | Foreign Key (Tree.node_id)  |

In this schema, the `node_id` is a unique identifier for each node, and the `parent_id` column establishes the parent-child relationship in the tree structure. If a node has no parent (i.e., it's a top-level node), the `parent_id` can be set to NULL.

### Example Data

The example data provided in the database is used to represent the tree structure you provided. It includes the following nodes:

- `root` is the top-level node.
- `ant`, `bear`, and `frog` are child nodes of the root.
- `cat` and `dog` are child nodes of `bear`.
- `elephant` is a child node of `dog`.

This structure represents the hierarchy as per your initial description.

You can populate the `Tree` table with the provided example data using SQL queries, and this schema can be extended with additional columns and features as needed for your specific application.

For example, you can use the following SQL query to insert the example data into the `Tree` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Tree (name, parent_id) VALUES
('root', NULL),
('ant', 1),
('bear', 1),
('cat', 3),
('dog', 3),
('elephant', 5),
('frog', 1);
