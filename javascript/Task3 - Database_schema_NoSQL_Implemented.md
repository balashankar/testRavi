# NoSQL Database Schema for Tree Structure

This document outlines a data schema for a NoSQL database, specifically designed to store and manage hierarchical tree data. In this example, we use MongoDB as the NoSQL database to represent the tree structure provided.

## Collection: `TreeNodes`

In MongoDB, data is organized into collections, which can be thought of as similar to tables in a relational database. For this tree structure, we will use a collection named `TreeNodes`.

### Document Structure

Each document in the `TreeNodes` collection represents a node in the tree. The schema includes the following fields:

- `_id`: A unique identifier (e.g., ObjectId) for each node.
- `label`: The name of the node.
- `children`: An array that stores child nodes. The `children` array can be nested to represent the hierarchical structure.

Here is an example document structure:

```json
{
    "_id": ObjectId("unique-identifier"),
    "label": "root",
    "children": [
        {
            "label": "ant"
        },
        {
            "label": "bear",
            "children": [
                {
                    "label": "cat"
                },
                {
                    "label": "dog",
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "label": "elephant"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "label": "frog"
        }
    ]
}
